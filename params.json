{"name":"SimSearch","tagline":"Item based retrieval engine with Bayesian Sets.","body":"SimSearch is an item based retrieval engine which implements [Bayesian Sets][0]. Bayesian Sets is a new framework for information retrieval in which a query consists of a set of items which are examples of some concept. The result is a set of items which attempts to capture the example concept given by the query.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the query with the two animated movies, [\"Lilo & Stitch\" and \"Up\"][1], Bayesian Sets would return other similar animated movies like \"Toy Story\". There is a nice [blog post][2] about item based search with Bayesian Sets. Feel free to [read][2] through it.\r\n\r\nThis module also adds the novel ability to combine full text queries with items. For example a query can be a combination of items and full text search keywords. In this case the results match the keywords and are re-ranked by similary to the queried items.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Bayesian Sets does not care about the actual [feature][3] engineering. In fact SimSearch only implements a simple [bag of words][4] model. However other feature types are possible as long as they can be binarized. The index is a set of files in a .xco and .yco format (more in the [tutorial][6]) that represents the presence of a feature value in a given item. So as long as you can create these files, SimSearch can read them and perform the matching.\r\n\r\nSimSearch has been [tested][5] on datasets with millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. Future plans include distributed search and real time indexing. For more information, feel free please to follow the [tutorial][6].\r\n\r\n[0]: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~heller/bsets.pdf\r\n[1]: http://imdb.cloudmining.net/search/similar=275847--Lilo+&+Stitch|1049413--Up/\r\n[2]: http://thenoisychannel.com/2010/04/04/guest-post-information-retrieval-using-a-bayesian-model-of-learning-and-generalization/\r\n[3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)\r\n[4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words\r\n[5]: http://imdb.cloudmining.net\r\n[6]: https://github.com/alexksikes/SimSearch/tree/master/tutorial/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
